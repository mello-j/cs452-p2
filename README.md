# CS452 Project 2
Justin Mello
Spring 2025

# Overview
This is a basic shell program to understand processes (creation, execution, signal handling, etc).


# Reflection
I found this confusing :) I think I need it to sit in my brain a bit longer. The code itself is not challenging but understanding how everything works just isn't clicking in my brain just yet.
I was actually impressed this time with using copilot (likely because a LOT of this code already exists out there and it was able to help steer me in the right direction if I got stuck. The problem is as a result some of those areas are still slightly confusing. I plan to review this a bit more in depth as I had to knock it out in a short time frame due to life stuff!).

Edit - I read through all the C pages provided. No confusion now...that's what I get for rushing through a project! I plan to add a few more tests, and input any feedback from the P2 Code review.
This was a fun project overall, and would be a neat thing to extend down the road.

Edit x 2 - I read through the man pages again, and had the chance to have Shane do my code review. Thinking aboud thread safety will be interesting (And something to keep it mind), and the clear point on using coding tools BUT understanding the why they are doing certain things (or why certain things are better) is so important.

I also found it fun to run make and make check in my shell, then my program again to see it create a shell within a shell within a shell....inception!

# Makefile Project Template

Steps to configure, build, run, and test the project.

## Building

```bash
make
```

## Testing

```bash
make check
```

## Clean

```bash
make clean
```

## Running

```bash
./myprogram
```

The above command will start the shell and you can play around with it (it should work...). Have fun!
