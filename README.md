# CS452 Project 2
Justin Mello
Spring 2025

# Overview
This is a basic shell program to understand processes (creation, execution, signal handling, etc).


# Reflection
I found this confusing :) I think I need it to sit in my brain a bit longer. The code itself is not challenging but understanding how everything works just isn't clicking in my brain just yet.
I was actually impressed this time with using copilot (likely because a LOT of this code already exists out there and it was able to help steer me in the right direction if I got stuck. The problem is as a result some of those areas are still slighly confusing. I plan to review this a bit more in depth as I had to knock it out in a short time frame due to life stuff!).

Edit - I read through all the C pages provided. No confusion now...that's what I get for rushing through a project! I plan to add a few more tests, and input any feedback from the P2 Code review.
This was a fun project overall, and would be a neat thing to extend down the road.

# Makefile Project Template

Steps to configure, build, run, and test the project.

## Building

```bash
make
```

## Testing

```bash

The above command will start the shell and you can play around with it (it should work...). Have fun!
